<h1>Who was Ada?</h1>
<h2><em>Who was Ada Lovelace?</em></h2>
<p>The woman most often known as ‘Ada Lovelace’ was born Ada Gordon in 1815, sole child of the brief and tempestuous marriage of the erratic poet George Gordon, Lord Byron, and his mathematics-loving wife Annabella Milbanke..</p>
<p>At the age of 19 she was married to an aristocrat, William King; when King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838 his wife became Lady Ada King, Countess of Lovelace. She is generally called Ada Lovelace, which is a little incorrect but saves confusion! She had three children.</p>

<p>Lovelace was deeply intrigued by Babbage’s plans for a tremendously complicated device he called the <strong>The Analytical Engine</strong> which was to combine the array of adding gears of his earlier Difference Engine with an elaborate punchcard operating system. ;</p>
